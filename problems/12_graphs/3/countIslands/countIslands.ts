/**
 * Calculate the number of the island represented by the given map.
 * Land is represented by numbers greater than 0 and water by 0s water is also represented by out of bounds.
 * Islands are land connected horizontally or vertically.
 * Islands are not connected diagonally.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} map - The map representing the island with values indicating land or water.
 * @return {number} The area of the island.
 * @example
 * let map1 = [

 * countIslands(map1) = 1
 *
 * map2 = [
 * 	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 * 	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 * 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
