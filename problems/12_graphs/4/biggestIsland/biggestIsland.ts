/**
 * Calculate the volume of the biggest island represented by the given map.
 * Land is represented by numbers greater than 0 and water by 0s
 * Islands are land connected horizontally or vertically.
 * Islands are not connected diagonally.
 * The volume of an island is the sum of all cells in the island.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} map - The map representing the island with values indicating land or water.
 * @return {number} The area of the island.
 * @example
 * let map1 = [
 * 	[1]
 * ]
 * biggestIsland(map1) = 1
 *
 * map2 = [
 * 	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 * 	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 * 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 * 	[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
 * ]
 * biggestIsland(map2) = 4

 * map3 = [
 * 	[2, 1, 0, 0, 10],
 * 	[1, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 * 	[0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 * 	[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
